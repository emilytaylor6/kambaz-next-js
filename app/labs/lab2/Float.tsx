                    Tell me, lover
                    Now that you made your change
                    Was your soul rediscovered?
                    Was your heart rearranged?
                    Are you still takin&apos; pills in the mornin&apos;?
                    And did you lose that longin&apos; now
                    For a walk through an ocean town?
                    &apos;Cause this town&apos;s just an ocean now
                    You don&apos;t hate the summers
                    You&apos;re just afraid of the space
                    Askin&apos; strangers for answers
                    To forget what they say
                    A boat beside a dock in the sunlight
                    And nothin&apos; but the water and the sunrise now
                    Just the lack of an open mouth
                    &apos;Cause this town&apos;s just an ocean now

                    Bad
                    I miss this place, your head and your heart
                    And my dad
                    Still tells me when they&apos;re playin&apos; your songs
                    Laughin&apos; at the way that you would say
                    &quot;If only, baby, there were cameras in the traffic lights
                    They&apos;d make me a star
                    They&apos;d make me a star&quot;
                    I wanna go to Maine
                    Mm, mm
                    I wanna go to Maine
                    Oh
                    Bad
                    I miss this place, your head and your heart
                    And my dad

                    Hm, I wanna go to Maine (mm)
                    Ooh-ooh, oh (mm)
                    I wanna go to Maine (mm)
                    Mm, God (mm)
                    Tell me, lover
                    Once you&apos;ve had a change of heart
                    &apos;Cause we&apos;re no more than the fossils
                    On Crescent Beach State Park, and we
                    Used to sing along to church bells on Sundays
                    And can you even hear &apos;em from the subway now?
                    And I hope that we make you proud
                    &apos;Cause this town&apos;s just an ocean now

                    I told you, love, if you could see it through my eyes
                    You&apos;d understand my fear of everything in sight
                    I know I&apos;d quickly sell my heart for some advice
                    On how to ease a troubled mind
                    My brain&apos;s a dog asleep that I cannot let lie
                    Cloudy head, though I can&apos;t find a single silver lining
                    Guess there is no hope for me in sight
                    To ease this troubled mind
                    I worry for the sun, yes, I worry for the snow
                    I worry I&apos;ll die young while I worry I&apos;ll grow old
                    Oh, I worry for the time I spent worrying alone
                    It makes me sad
                    It takes me back
                    I break in half
                    Ah-ooh, I break in half
                    I took a bus out to the city where you live
                    Eaves dropped on strangers&apos; conversations with their kids
                    In hopes that maybe they&apos;d say something relevant
                    To ease my worried head
